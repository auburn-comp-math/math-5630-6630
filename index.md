# Before you start

This repository hosts the course material for Math 5630/6630: **Introduction to Numerical Analysis I** at Auburn University. The course will use the textbook written by A. Quarteroni, R. Saaco, and F. Saleri, *Numerical Mathematics*, Second Edition, Springer, New York, 2007.

The course will cover the following topics:

- Floating point arithmetic
- Root finding
- Interpolation and approximation
- Numerical differentiation and integration
- Numerical solutions of ordinary differential equations

This course is an introduction to numerical analysis. It is designed to provide a solid foundation in numerical methods and their applications.   Both fundamental theory and programming are required throughout the course. The prerequisites for the theory part are

- Linear Differential Equations (2650)
- Topics in Linear Algebra (2660)

```{note}
The default programming language for this class is ``Python`` and ``MATLAB``, the other script languages such as ``R``, ``Julia`` are also supported.
