# Root Finding

Root finding is a fundamental problem in numerical analysis and has many applications in science and engineering such as solving nonlinear equations, optimization problems, and differential equations. Usually, a closed form of the root is not available, and we need to compute the root numerically. In this section, we will discuss some of the most common methods for root finding.
