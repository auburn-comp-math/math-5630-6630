# Before you start

This repository hosts the course material for Math 5630/6630: **Introduction to Numerical Analysis I** at Auburn University. The course will use the textbook written by *A First Course in Numerical Methods* by U. M. Ascher and C. Greif, 2011.

The following books are also recommended for this course:

- *Numerical Mathematics* by A. Quarteroni, R. Saaco, and F. Saleri, 2007.
- *Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice* by Lloyd N. Trefethen, 2019
- *Numerical Methods for Ordinary Differential Equations: Initial Value Problems* by D Griffith, D. Higham, 2010
- *Concise Numerical Mathematics* by R. Plato, 2003
- *Numerical computing with IEEE floating point arithmetic* by M. Overturn, 2001

The course will cover the following topics:

- Floating point arithmetic
- Root finding
- Interpolation and approximation
- Numerical differentiation and integration
- Numerical solutions of ordinary differential equations

This course is an introduction to numerical analysis. It is designed to provide a solid foundation in numerical methods and their applications.   Both fundamental theory and programming are required throughout the course. The prerequisites for the theory part are

- Linear Differential Equations (2650)
- Topics in Linear Algebra (2660)

```{note}
The default programming language for this class is ``Python`` and ``MATLAB``, the other script languages such as ``R``, ``Julia`` are also supported.
